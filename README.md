# aleo-wallet-sdk
The Aleo Wallet SDK provides tooling for custodians and engineers to interact with the [Aleo](https://aleo.org/) network.

This includes:
* An RPC client compatible with [SnarkOS](https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkOS)
* Basic send and receive support.

To get started with this library, you will need to have the global instantiated Aleo [parameters](https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkVM/tree/testnet2/parameters).
You can generate these files using the scripts found [here](https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkVM/tree/testnet2/parameters/scripts).

This software is in active development. Do not use for production.
